This blog post demonstrates how to leverage all the available SEO metadata fields in our enhanced Astro blog setup. By properly configuring these fields, you can significantly improve your content's discoverability and search engine rankings.

## Available SEO Fields

Our enhanced content schema now supports the following SEO-specific fields:

### Core RSS Fields (Required)

- **title**: The page title that appears in search results and browser tabs
- **description**: A compelling summary that appears in search result snippets
- **pubDate**: When the article was first published

### Enhanced SEO Fields (Optional)

- **ogImage**: A custom image for social media sharing (separate from heroImage)
- **keywords**: An array of relevant keywords for search engines
- **canonicalURL**: The preferred URL for this content (helps prevent duplicate content issues)
- **robots**: Custom instructions for search engine crawlers
- **author**: The article author for attribution and authorship markup
- **updatedDate**: When the article was last modified

## How These Fields Improve SEO

### Search Engine Optimization

- **Keywords** help search engines understand your content's topics
- **Robots** directives control how search engines crawl and index your content
- **Canonical URLs** prevent duplicate content penalties

### Social Media Optimization

- **Open Graph images** make your content more engaging when shared
- **Article metadata** provides rich snippets for social platforms

### User Experience

- **Clear descriptions** help users understand what they'll find
- **Author information** builds trust and authority
- **Updated dates** show content freshness

## Best Practices

1. **Keep descriptions between 150-160 characters** for optimal search result display
2. **Use relevant, specific keywords** rather than keyword stuffing
3. **Ensure canonical URLs are absolute** and point to the preferred version
4. **Optimize images** for both hero display and social sharing
5. **Keep titles under 60 characters** to prevent truncation in search results

This enhanced SEO setup gives you fine-grained control over how your content appears across search engines and social media platforms, helping you reach a wider audience and improve engagement.
