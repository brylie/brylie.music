## About the Harmonic Series

The harmonic series is the foundation of musical tone and timbre. When any object vibrates (like a guitar string or air in a flute), it doesn't just vibrate at one frequency. It vibrates at many frequencies simultaneously.

These frequencies are integer multiples of the **fundamental frequency**:

- **1st Harmonic (Fundamental):** The pitch you hear (e.g., 220 Hz)
- **2nd Harmonic:** 2x freq (440 Hz) - One octave up
- **3rd Harmonic:** 3x freq (660 Hz) - Perfect 5th above that
- **4th Harmonic:** 4x freq (880 Hz) - Two octaves up

### How to Use

1.  **Play:** Click the Play button to start the sound engine.
2.  **Toggle Harmonics:** Click the numbered buttons (1-16) to turn specific harmonics on or off.
3.  **Adjust Levels:** Use the sliders to change the volume of the fundamental or individual harmonics.
4.  **Visualize:** Watch how the waveform shape changes as you add more complex harmonics.

### Why It Matters

The relative volume of these harmonics is what gives each instrument its unique "color" or **timbre**. A clarinet has strong odd harmonics, while a violin has a rich set of all harmonics. By adjusting these levels, you are performing **additive synthesis**—building complex sounds from simple sine waves.
