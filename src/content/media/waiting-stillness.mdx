From the album *Itse*, "Waiting Stillness" features melodic piano enhanced with shimmering, granular delay processing.

## Sonic Texture

The granular delay creates a cloud of sound particles around the piano notes, extending and transforming the acoustic instrument into an ethereal, ambient soundscape. Each note blooms and dissolves, creating a sense of suspended time.

This piece explores the space between movement and stillness, presence and memory, as piano phrases are caught and scattered through time by the granular processing.
