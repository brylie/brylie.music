From the *Renewed Energy* album, "Gently Drifting" takes the listener on a serene trip down a meandering river valley.

## Musical Elements

The piece features steady rhythms that flow like water, modulating harmonies that shift like changing landscapes, and clattering percussion that evokes the sounds of nature along the riverbanks.

This composition captures the peaceful, meditative quality of drifting downstream, allowing yourself to be carried by the current while observing the ever-changing scenery.
