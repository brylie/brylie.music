Using generative modular synthesis to explore the intersection of rhythm and melody in the eurorack format. This performance features a collection of modules working together to create evolving soundscapes and rhythmic patterns.

## Equipment

This performance was created using VCV Rack, a Eurorack modular synthesizer system. It features modules for:

- Generative rhythm generation
- Melodic voice synthesis
- Effects processing
- Modulation and control

## Creative Process

The piece develops organically through the interaction of various generative processes, with minimal intervention to allow the system to explore its own musical possibilities. The result is a meditative exploration of electronic sound.
