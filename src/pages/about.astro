          <p>
            I create music as a tool for healing and community connection.
            Drawing inspiration from impressionistic composers and modern
            ambient artists like Elija Fox, Nils Frahm, and Max Richter, I blend
            acoustic piano with electronic textures to create immersive,
            contemplative soundscapes.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">My Sound</h2>
            <p>My music combines:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Piano-centric compositions and minimal improvisations</li>
              <li>Ambient electronic textures and atmospheres</li>
              <li>Blending of acoustic and electronic timbres</li>
              <li>Modulating effects creating organic, evolving soundscapes</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mt-4">
              I work primarily in Bitwig for sound design and modulation, and
              Logic for piano recording and final production. Each piano piece
              begins as improvisation, then gets refined for a listener-friendly
              experience. My Bitwig compositions utilize generative techniques
              to keep the soundscapes fresh and evolving.

            <p>
              My creative output spans a wide spectrum of electronic and
              instrumental music, marked by atmospheric pieces that weave
              together diverse instruments, timbres, and textures. My work has
              been featured in podcasts including The Global Justice Now Podcast
              (9 episodes), Heritage Radio Network, as well as in independent
              video games and documentary films.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've released several albums exploring themes of contemplation,
              healing, and transformation, with recent work focusing
              increasingly on solo piano and ambient compositions.

              Community & Performance
            </h2>
            <p>
              Music serves as more than artistic expression. It's also a tool
              for healing and connection. I regularly volunteer as a pianist at
              community spaces, where I accompany singing groups and provide
              ambient improvisation during community gatherings.
            </p>
            <p>
              These performances reflect my belief that music can create spaces
              for reflection, connection, and wellbeing.
